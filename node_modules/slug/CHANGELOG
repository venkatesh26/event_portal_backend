2.1.1
-----

Restore IE 11 support by removing arrow functions.

2.1.0
-----

Fallback to base64 if slug is empty. This allows minimal out-of-the-box support
for character sets not in the default mappings.

2.0.0
-----

Add support for Farsi. (Thanks, @hassan-jahan!)

This is being released as a breaking change because it changes some of
the slugs for Arabic strings. It probably won't break anything, but just
in case....
